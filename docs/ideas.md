**Team Name:** Team Tau

**application name:** PC Building Helper

**Team Overview:** Guanxu Zhou(MikaIcarus), Hang Zheng(HangZ1), Yuchen Liu(3TH4N)

**Innovative Idea:** There are many applications related to our applications. For example, Amazon and BestBuy have all sorts of computer components we can use for our database and redirect our users to for purchase. Also, there are many custom PC application that allows the user to custom their PC, but they are confusing for people with no PC building experience, while our application provides an entry-level assistant

**Important Components:** Our project will provide a function that takes in a variety of input from the user, such as budget, performance, personal favor..etc, and output all the possible solution that meets their need, along with a description on the advantages and disadvantages, and the link for the best purchase. The user can then choose the one we pick for them or store different parts in the shopping car to custom their ideal PC
