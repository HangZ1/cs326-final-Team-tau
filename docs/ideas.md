**Team Name:** Team Tau

**application name:** PC Building Helper

**Team Overview:** Guanxu Zhou(MikaIcarus), Hang Zheng(HangZ1), Yuchen Liu(3TH4N)

**Innovative Idea:** There are many applications related to our applications. For example, Amazon and BestBuy have all sorts of computer components we can use for our database and redirect our users to for purchase. Also, there are some custom PC applications that allow the user to custom their PC, but the users were required to put in the PC component themselves, and the application will simply tell you how much it would cost, while our application will provide assistant for the entry-level user as to how well their PC can perform and maybe some score.

**Important Components:** Our project will provide a function that takes in a variety of input from the user, such as budget, performance, personal favor..etc, and output all the possible solution that meets their need, along with a description on the advantages and disadvantages, and the link for the best purchase. The user can then choose from the one we pick for them or store different parts in the shopping car to custom their ideal PC
